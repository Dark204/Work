The data is from the work " Mahak-il:diversity based oversampling approach to alleviate the class imbalance issue in software defect prediction". In order to use code, find the datasets and run, then input OUT=LearningPro(data,1), "1" represent parameter of "km"; "learningpro" will call "once" for ten-fold evaluation; "DenE" introduces the code of the algorithms. If you want to make use of this code, please acknowledge us by citing our work "Software defect prediction based on fuzzy weighted extreme learning machine with relative density information".
