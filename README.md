The data is from the work " Mahak-il:diversity based oversampling approach to alleviate the class imbalance issue in software defect prediction".
In order to use code, find the datasets and run, then input OUT=LearningPro(data,1),1represent parameter of km.
Once represents five-fold program for the comparison algorithms£¬and learningpro will call "once" for more times£»
DenE introduces the code of the algorithms.
